SK-CS20MTECH11002.cpp

I have used Ubuntu to do the assignment , run the following command to compile:
For VC-CS20MTECH11002.cpp
g++ -std=c++11 -pthread VC-CS20MTECH11002.cpp -o VC-CS20MTECH11002

For SK-CS20MTECH11002.cpp
g++ -std=c++11 -pthread SK-CS20MTECH11002.cpp -o SK-CS20MTECH11002

For direct excecution ,use this:
For VC-CS20MTECH11002.cpp
./VC-CS20MTECH11002

For SK-CS20MTECH11002.cpp
